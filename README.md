# Binary-Search-Algorithm

The binary search algorithm is one of the searching algorithms.
On a sorted array, the algorithm findes if the target is larger or smaller than the item in middle-index of the array.
If it's smaller, the right part of the array is discarted.
If it's larger,  the left part is being discarted.

This proccess of halfing the array, keeps happening until the index corresponds to the searched target.
